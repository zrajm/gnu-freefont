		Installing the Free UCS outline fonts
		=====================================

1. UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD Systems

The rather awkward "UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD" agglomeration is used to
denote any system capable of running an X server with FreeType
<http://www.freetype.org/>, a high-quality free font rasterizer.

1.1 KDE local installation

Users of KDE can install .ttf files on a per-user basis using the KDE 
Control Center module "kcmfontinst", which may appear in the menu as

	Settings -> System Administration -> Font Installer

This is especially helpful for developers and testers.

1.2 Debian GNU/Linux

Users of Debian GNU/Linux system will probably want to use the Debian package,
available from the Debian site, 

	<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/ttf-freefont.html>,

or any of its mirrors.

Install them by issuing the command
	apt-get install ttf-freefont


1.3 Generic X-windows

	1) Fetch the freefont-ttf.tar.gz package with Free UCS outline fonts
	   in the TrueType format.

	2) Unpack TrueType fonts into a suitable directory,
	   e.g. /usr/local/share/fonts/default/TrueType/

	3) If you have chosen any other directory, make sure the directory you
	   used to install the fonts is listed in the path searched by the X
	   Font Server by editing the config file in /etc/X11/.

	   In some systems, you the directory to the "catalogue=" in the
	   /etc/X11/fs/config.

	4) Run ttmkfdir in the directory where you unpacked the fonts.


2. Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP

   Probably something like Windows Vista:

   Microsoft Windows Vista
	1) From Start menu, open Control Panels
	2) Drag-n-drop font files onto Fonts control panel
           You may get a dialog saying
        	"Windows needs your permission to continue"
           2 a) Click Continue


3. Mac OS X

Installing on Mac OS X consists of moving the .ttf files to either
	/Library/Fonts/ or ~/Library/Fonts/
depending on whether they should be available to all users on your system
or just to yourself.
