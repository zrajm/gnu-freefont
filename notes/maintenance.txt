1)  Makefile

    The command
    	make
    will build the TrueType font files in the sfd directory.
    The command
        make package
    creates four archive files: one tarball of sources (SFD files), a
    tarball of TrueType fonts, and a tarball and a zip file of OpenType
    fonts. The naming convention is:

        freefont-sfd-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
        freefont-ttf-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
        freefont-otf-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
        freefont-otf-yyyymmdd.zip

    where yyyymmdd is the year, month and date of release.

    The Makefile also has other targets, for building individual components
    of the distribution.

2)  Adding files to the download area

    The gnupload script, which has some connection to automake, is the 
    neatest way to upload files to Savannah.  You may have to acquire it
    from somebody.

    Requires 'ncftp'

    /bin/sh ~/bin/gnupload --to ftp.gnu.org:freefont freefont-otf-20080324.zip

    It prompts for a PGP password, creates the signature files required
    by the Savannah upload procedures, and uploads all of them.

3)  Creating detached signature file, as in the "raw" upload procedures:

    http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Automated-Upload-Registration

    gpg -b freefont-ttf-20060126.tar.gz

    This creates a "detached GPD binary signature" file freefont-ttf.tar.gz.sig

4)  Commiting a CVS file

    export CVS_RSH=ssh
    cvs -z3 -d user_name@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/freefont co freefont

    cd freefont/sfd
    cvs commit FreeSans.sfd

5)  Tagging a release in CVS

    cvs rtag RELEASE_TAG_NAME freefont

    Removing a tag

    cvs rtag -d RELEASE_TAG_NAME freefont

    Retreiving a tagged release

    cvs checkout -P -r RELEASE_TAG_NAME freefont

6)  Using Change Log mode in Emacs

    C-x 4 a adds a new entry to the change log file

7)  New release procedures
	Update the Changelog.
	Review the AUTHORS and CREDITS files for competeness.
        Ensure that "make tests" completes cleanly.

	Tag new releases with tag named RELEASE_date, where date is the date.
	Add release date field value to bug report field "Release".
	Upload the archive files to Savannah.

	Write to freefont-announce@gnu.org
	Write to info-gnu@gnu.org
	Write to pkg-fonts-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org, 
		and Debian freefont-ttf packager

	Mark "In CVS" bug reports as "Fixed"
