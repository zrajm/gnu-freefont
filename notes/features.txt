	OpenType features in GNU FreeFont

The OpenType font standard specifies numerous "features", which describe
how glyphs should be rendered under certain circumstances.

Some features, such as ligatures, substitute one glyph (or glyphs) with
others.  Other features such as kerning and mark placement adjust the
positioning of glyphs. 

A feature may be activated for text in a certain language or region
(as can be specified in HTML elements with the "lang" attribute), and
some are activated only in case other features are not activated.

The actual rendering of these features is done by the font rendering
software in the operating system or application or printer, not by the
font itself.  As of this writing, feature support is still far from
perfect in many environments.

The features are encoded in the font's "lookup tables".  Each table has
a four-byte name.

The feature lookup tables used in FreeFont include:
