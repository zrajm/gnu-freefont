	Usage of GNU FreeFont

Language scripts and faces
==========================

There are three faces (serif, sans-serif, and monospace), and four styles
(regular, bold, cursive/italic, and bold cursive/italic) for each face.
There is one font file per face/style combination: 12 files in total.

The letters for various languages, as well as specialized symbols, exist
among the various font files, but they are not uniformly populated.
All the fonts have complete support for Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek, as
well as most of the extensions for those scripts.

At this time, serif regular has by far the largest number of letters, and
supports the largest number of writing scripts.  However there are writing
scripts supported by the sans-serif but not by serif.

For an overview of which scripts and sets of symbols are supported by
which face, see the FreeFont 'coverage' web page.

Font features
=============

FreeFont has numerous font "features" that perform alterations to the basic
letters of the font, replacing them with other letters, or positioning them
with respect to other letters.

Many features are activated automatically, but in some environments, they
present some user control.  This documents those features with user control.

Language-specific features
==========================

Some OpenType font features are activated only when the text is specified to
be of a certain language. 

This is done in HTML by enclosing the text with a tag whose 'lang' attribute
is set to the appropriate ISO 632.2 language code.  In a word processor, 
any block of text can be given a language setting.

Latin
-----
Catalan	ligature improving l·l
Dutch	ligatures for ij, IJ
Sami	localized form for letter Eng
Turkish	overrides ligatures fi ffi of Latin
Vietnamese	fine positioning stacked accents.  See also below.

Greek
-----
Greek	curly forms of beta and theta in italic text

Cyrillic
--------
Ukrainian	ligature for double i-diaresis
Serbian/Macedonian	localized form of 'be', and others in italic
	[the 'sha' with line below is available as a character variant ]
Bulgarian	style set for modern alternative glyphs

Hebrew
------
Yiddish	raised vowels under yo

Devanagari
----------
Sanskrit	much larger set of ligatures

Hindi, Marathi	better spacing of Western punctuation marks
	[historic ligatures: for ligatures common in Old Hindi]

Indic languages
---------------

The 'danda' character is encoded in Unicode only in the Devanagari range.
When writing in scripts of other Indic languages, this same character is to
be used.  But the shapes and line thicknesses of glyphs vary slightly from
one script to another, so the same glyph for 'danda' may not fit all scripts.

By specifying the language of the text, an appropriate glyph for 'danda'
may be obtained.

Style sets
==========

These replacements are meant to indicate variant typgraphic style, and
are activated by enabling a "Style Set" in the document.

Cyrillic	Bulgarian modern (ss01)

Devanagari	Bombay (ss02), Calcutta (ss03), Nepali (ss04)

Greek		Curly non-inital beta, and initial theta (ss05)
		(In italic faces for Greek text, these are the default.)

Character variants
==================
These are uaually a replacement for a single letter with another.

Greek: lunate sigma (cv00), script kappa (cv01)

Cyrillic: in italic faces, Serbian/Macedonian underscored 'sha' (cv00)

Discretionary features
======================
These features are accessible only from typesetting software.
Typically the user must specifically request them.

Unless otherwise noted, these are available only in FreeSerif.

Ligatures and substitutions
---------------------------

Arabic, Armenian, Hebrew, German, Dutch


Stacked accents
---------------

In the Latin ranges, there are a number of characters with one accent
upon another.  These cause typographical difficulties.

Especially in the Vietnamese range, for some purposes it is best for
these accents to stand high above the letter, but for others, it is
best for the accents to remain within the line bounds.
By default, the accents stand high, exceeding vertical line bounds,
although this may cause clipping and refresh issues in some applications. 
A second set of glyphs, with "flattened" accents that keep inside the
vertical line bounds, may be had by enabling the 'flac' feature.

Small captials
--------------

A limited set of specially drawn small capital letters in Latin.

Superscript and subscript
-------------------------

Transform a limited set of characters--mostly Latin letters and numerals--
to versions well-sized and positioned as superscript or subscript.

Numeral styles
--------------

The default numerals of FreeSerif are mono-spaced and of even height.
It also features proportionally-spaced numerals, and "old-style" numerals--
those which vary in height and sometimes go beneath the baseline.
These can be had at discretion.

Diagonal fractions
------------------

A limited set of diagonal fraction substitutions are available at discretion.
The set is more than what is encoded in Unicode.
They work with the ASCII slash or the mathematical slash U+2215.
The transform a sequence "number-slash-number" to a diagonal form.

Zero
----

A slashed form of the numeral zero is available at discretion.
Available in all faces.

Alternative characters
======================

FreeSerif has some listings of alternatives for specific characters.
Again these are used primarily by specialized typesetting software.

	Greek, Latin

This face also has also a listing of ornamental versions of punctuation 
marks such as bullets and stars (ornm).

Use in HTML with CSS
====================
Some web browsers have lately become very typography-savvy, having long
outstripped word processors in this regard.

In basic HTML, it is most important to properly specify the langugage of
each text element, using HTML 'lang' attributes.  Many typographic
features of the font will be activated only for certain languages.

If the whole document is in English, for example, the attribute 
	lang="en-US"
in the <html> element will suffice.  Any sub-element can be given a 
separate language when needed.

With CSS, the "font-family" property can be specified as one of
	'freeserif', 'freesans' or 'freemono',
and several other properties influencing typographic presentation can
also be set: "font-weight", "font-style", etc.
In CSS 3, a special property 'font-feature-settings' that gives explicit
control of OpenType font features was introduced.  Several browsers
now have experimental implementations of this feature.  For example,
Mozilla Firefox has "-moz-font-feature-settings".  The value of the
Firefox property is a comma delimited string, of 4-character feature
tags and their value, such as
	"dlig,cc00=1,liga=0"
(where 0 indicates "disable"; 1 indicates "enable").

These explicit features are specific to particular fonts.  So this 
technology is meant to work with "web fonts", a means of delivering
a font with your web page.  See the document "webfont_guidelines.txt"
for more information about this.

Use in LaTeX
============
It is possible to use Unicode fonts in recent LaTeX implementations, but in
	LuaTeX http://www.luatex.org/ and
	XeTeX http://tug.org/xetex/
it is particularly easy to use Unicode text, and to enable font features.
Recent versions of these systems use the 'fontspec' package to choose fonts
and features.

LuaTeX note: for lualatex to search the local font directory ~/.fonts/f,
the OSFONTDIR variable may be set, either in the luatex config files
or as an environment variable, e.g.
	export OSFONTDIR=/home/swhite/.fonts/f//

A LaTeX (.tex) document in these implementations might contain the lines:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{ltxdockit}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont[]{FreeSerif}

\newfontfamily{\altbg}[Script=Cyrillic,Language=Bulgarian,
Variant={1}]{FreeSerif}
\newfontfamily{\altsb}[Script=Cyrillic,Language=Serbian,
ItalicFeatures={Script=Cyrillic, Language=Serbian, Style=Alternate},
BoldItalicFeatures={Script=Cyrillic, Language=Serbian, Style=Alternate} ]
{FreeSerif}

\begin{document}
{\fontspec[Script=Default,Fractions={On}]{FreeSerif}
1/7 3/10 7/10}

x\raisebox{-0.5ex}{{\scriptsize ai}}
x{\fontspec[Script=Default,VerticalPosition={Inferior}]{FreeSerif}
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+−(0123456789)} \\
x\raisebox{0.85ex}{{\scriptsize ai}}
x{\fontspec[Script=Default,VerticalPosition={Superior}]{FreeSerif}
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+−(0123456789)}

{\fontspec[Script=Latin]{FreeSerif}
\textsc{Small Caps} }

{ Bсички хора се раждат свободни и равни по достойнство и права.

\altbg

\altsb{
Oнa су oбдaрeнa рaзумoм и свeшћу и трeбajeдни прeмa другимa дa пoступajу у духу брaтствa. 

\textit{
Oнa су oбдaрeнa рaзумoм и свeшћу и трeбajeдни прeмa другимa дa пoступajу у духу брaтствa. 
}
}

\end{document}
